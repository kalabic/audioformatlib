# AudioFormatLib
C# library for handling basic audio formats and conversions between them. Work in progress.

Resampler code is follow-up on work in [kalabic/libstreamresample-dotnet](https://github.com/kalabic/libstreamresample-dotnet) (a fork of [xycui/libresamplesharp](https://github.com/xycui/libresamplesharp) by Xianyi Cui).

Parts of library use code from [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) project, copyright 2020 Mark Heath.
